# ICS3U Snake Game
One of my very first real projects in my Grade 11 Computer Science class was to create a snake game using Python 3.X,
together with a semi well-known library called PyGame. 

Orignially, the project was supposed to be built off of a prebuilt template that the teacher provided us, but I didn't
really like that so instead I opted for building my own version, using object oriented programming concepts, which at the
time of writing this game, we did not learn.

Anyway, this is my first real Python program that uses classes.

I ended up getting 100% on this project.

## Prerequisites
This game runs off of a Python Library called PyGame, and the installation of PyGame is required.

**To install PyGame on a unix based system (does not include Mac):**

`python3 -m pip install pygame --user`

**To install PyGame on a Windows system:**

`py -m pip install pygame --user`

To install on a Mac or anywhere else, I suggest you Google it.

## Running the Game
Right well this is easy. 

Navigate to the folder where all the game information is stored in CMD or Terminal and enter the following command:

**On Windows:**

`game.py`

**Unix:**

`python game.py`

**If you have both python2 and python3 installed, run**

`python3 game.py`

## Built With
* [PyGame](http://www.pygame.org/news) - The Python Library I used

* [JetBrain PyCharm CE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - The IDE I used. Highly recommended as opposed to the regular shell.

* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - Duh.
